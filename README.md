# Changing-Seasons
This is a Computer Graphics project which showcase changing of different seasons.
The Earth is enormous, and each region has a distinct climate. Summer, winter, and rainy 
seasons are the most prominent seasons. At different times of the year, different portions 
of the world experience different seasons. Seasons fluctuate throughout the year as the 
earth revolves around the sun. The main focus of this project is to showcase different 
seasons and the transition phases between them. And as part of interactive part of the 
project we can control the movement of clouds with the left and right buttons of the mouse, 
speed of boat changes based on the left and right arrow keys, we can also make it rain or 
stop it based using the ‘r’ and ‘s’ key. The ‘w’ and ‘e’ key can be used to control the 
windmill rotation.
This Graphics package is based on the OpenGL library functions. The programming 
language used here is C++ using OpenGL libraries.
